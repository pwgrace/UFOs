# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis
#### The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage that filters UFO sighting data based on date, city, state, country, and shape. 
## Results
### Edit the form on the left hand to filter the data. For example, to view all of the instances recorded in El Cajon that had a triangle shape then first enter el cajon in the city bar and then triangle in the shape bar.

## Summary
#### One drawback of this design is that there is not an easy way to see what shapes are being referenced. One way to fix the issue would be to create drop-down menus rather than having the user enter the words themselves. It would also be helpful to show that the date range of this data is within a 2 week period.
